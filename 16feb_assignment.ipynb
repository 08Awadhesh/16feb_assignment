    "**Q1**. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer** **Database:** A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured manner to facilitate efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. It is a software system that is used to manage and store data in a manner that allows easy access and retrieval of information. Databases are used in a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile applications, and enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems that differ in their structure, functionality, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differnce between SQL and NoSQL:**\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use tables to store data. They use SQL as their primary language for querying and manipulating data. SQL databases are widely used in applications that require a high degree of data integrity and consistency, such as financial applications, e-commerce, and inventory management systems. Examples of popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that use document-based, key-value, or graph-based data models for storing and managing data. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media data, sensor data, and log files. NoSQL databases are highly scalable, flexible, and provide fast data access. Examples of popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB."

    "**Q5:** Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: Primary key** A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. Primary keys ensure that each row in a table can be identified and accessed in a unique way. Primary keys can be used to enforce data integrity, as they prevent duplicate rows and ensure that each row has a unique identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table of employees, the \"employee_id\" column could be used as the primary key. This would ensure that each row in the table represents a unique employee, and that no two employees can have the same \"employee_id\" value.\n",

    "**forgin key** A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys define relationships between tables and ensure that data is consistent between related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a table of orders, there might be a column \"customer_id\" that refers to the primary key of a table of customers. This would ensure that each order is associated with a specific customer, and that the customer information is consistent between the orders table and the customers table."
